# Agentic AI Systems

**What are agentic systems?**  
AI applications composed of autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that plan, reason, and act collaboratively to achieve goals using LLMs and tools.

**T2 Software's Approach**  
We emphasize reliability, observability, and integration with real-world enterprise infrastructure—production-grade systems, not demos.

**Frameworks**
CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK.

**Enterprise Consulting**  
We help teams design scalable multi-agent workflows, integrate them into existing systems, and align with KPIs.

**Model Work**
Focus on orchestration, retrieval, and evaluation—not full model training. Fine-tuning available via partners.
