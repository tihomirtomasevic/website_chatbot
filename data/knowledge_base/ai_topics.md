# AI Topics and Explanations

**What are LLM Agents?**  
Autonomous or semi-autonomous processes that use large language models to plan actions, call APIs, and execute tasks.

**LLM App vs. Agentic System**  
An app answers or generates text; an agentic system can reason, plan, and act through tool use.

**Reliability**  
Ensured via orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI), retries, task decomposition, and evaluation tools like LangFuse/TruLens.

**Enterprise Integration**  
LLMs embedded into workflows via APIs, queues, and retrieval pipelines.

**Custom Toolchains**  
T2 Software designs reusable orchestration layers for clients needing scalable agent frameworks.
